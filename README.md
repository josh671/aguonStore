# Aguon Store

## Motivation

We have discovered a business opportunity for a local convenience store on Guam called "Aguon Store". 
<br />
Local convenience stores, also referred to as Mom-and-Pop stores, are abundant and part of everyday life for local residents. These stores provide a variety of items from snacks and drinks (local favorites as well!) to necessity items like toilet tissue and garbage bags. 
 <br />
We would like to create a simple application in which a customer can place an order through their smartphone, and their order will be ready for payment and pick-up upon arrival. 
<br />
This application will:
- Save customers time and effort through ease of use
- Possibly increase sales revenue through onine orders
- Serve as a stepping stone for furthering business operations (For example online payments and deliveries)
